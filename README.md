# Protocol: Night Light 📹🌒

**Protocol: Night Light** is an indirect-control surveillance thriller and tactical puzzle game. Players take on the role of a Remote Operator navigating a civilian through a haunted suburban landscape by manipulating smart-home technology and street lighting.

## 🛰️ Design Pillars
* **Systemic Interaction:** The player does not move the protagonist directly. Instead, they influence AI behavior by manipulating the environment.
* **Atmospheric Surveillance:** Tension is built through limited information, using grainy camera feeds, static, and audio cues to represent what is "not seen."
* **The Power-Fear Loop:** A resource management challenge where players must balance camera usage (seeing) and environmental triggers (acting) against the Citizen's rising fear.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview
* **Platform:** PC.
* **Aesthetics:** High-contrast UI with BlueJ-style logic architecture.
* **Core Loop:** Monitor Camera Feeds → Predict Shadow Movements → Trigger Smart-Home Tech → Guide Citizen to Safety.

## 🎭 Mission Objective
Maintain the local power grid while uncovering the dark history of the neighborhood through ambient data mining. The mission fails if the "Shadows" consume the "Citizen."
