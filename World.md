# World Building & Level Design

## 📖 Ambient Data Mining
The narrative is uncovered through indirect methods:
* **Audio Logs:** Triggered by smart-speakers as the Citizen passes nearby homes.
* **Text Intercepts:** Short, cryptic messages discovered by "pinging" local routers.
* **Environmental Shifts:** The neighborhood layout physically changes (e.g., a park transforming into a graveyard) as the Citizen's fear increases.

## 🏘️ Level Themes: The Suburban Grid
Levels function as pathfinding puzzles with three distinct zones:
* **Safe Zones:** Porches and streetlights that provide visibility and lower fear.
* **Dead Zones:** Narrow alleys with no camera coverage requiring audio-only navigation.
* **Strategic Hubs:** Areas with high-power interactables like garages and sprinkler systems.

## 🚀 Branching Narratives
Players can guide the Citizen toward different "Safe Houses," which unlocks different fragments of the neighborhood's history and leads to varied story conclusions.
